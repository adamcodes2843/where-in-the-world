## Overview

This is a country lookup app. Using the data.json file, 8 random country cards are rendered on the home page. You can filter the countries by region or search for a country with text input. Each card links to a dynamically rendered info page. Users can toggle light and dark mode. Learn more below.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all the countries on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

## My process

- Review the style guide and Figma pages
- Decide on the tools I want to use for this project's specific needs
- Using a mobile first strategy, start building out the components
- Add types and React/Javascript functionality as needed

### Built with

- Vite
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Typescript

### What I learned

This was a very simple and straight forward project, which was nice after two relatively complex fullstack projects. I went from create-react-app to Next13 and stayed there with endless things to learn for months, so it was good to finally get around to my first Vite project. I practiced using react-router-dom, Typescript, Tailwind, etc. 

### Continued development

I've been learning about vitest, so I'll practice that while I'm creating Vite apps. I have been reading up on static site generation and server side rendering with Astro and Next 13, so I'll be getting back to that with my upcoming projects. I want to learn new Javascript libraries. I'm going to continue to practice Svelte and use it for an app soon. I will develop my Typescript skills as I build new projects. I need to review advanced CSS features. I'm reading a Python book and comparing it to Javascript as a review as well. I want to develop backend skills using a roadmap and get more practice with databases.
